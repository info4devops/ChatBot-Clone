What is ChatBOT?

ChatBOT is an AI language model trained on vast amounts of human conversation data. It’s capable of generating human-like text responses based on the input it receives. From answering questions to engaging in conversation, ChatBOT can simulate natural language interactions with users, making it an invaluable tool for enhancing user engagement.

Why ChatBOT?

Personalized Interactions: ChatBOT can understand and respond to user queries in a natural and conversational manner, creating personalized interactions that keep users engaged.
24/7 Availability: Unlike human agents, ChatBOT is available 24/7 to assist users, providing instant responses to their queries and ensuring a seamless user experience.
Scalability: With ChatBOT deployed in our application, we can handle a large volume of user interactions without compromising performance, ensuring scalability as our user base grows.
How We’re Deploying ChatBOT

To deploy ChatBOT on our EKS, we’re leveraging Jenkins as our CICD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment) tool and deploying the chatbot within a Docker container. This approach allows us to automate the deployment process, ensuring efficient and reliable delivery of updates and enhancements to our users.
